# My Hyprland Dots


Hello there! It seems you probably stumbled upon this from my profile, these are some of my dotfiles for my Arch Linux install,
these are not meant for public used and require prior knowledge to understand how to set up. For AUR/Pacman packages, i have provided a script.

These are intended for Arch Linux, you may have to adjust for your distro config-wise. 

If you intend to install these, please make sure you fully understand how to use Hyprland and Waybar, I recommend checking out their documentation pages:
- [https://wiki.hypr.land/](Hyprland)
- [https://waybar.org/category/guide/](Waybar)

# Package Install Script
ONLY FOR INTENDED ARCH LINUX, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

To install packages for **Arch Linux**, run the following commands

``chmod +x install_packages && ./install_packages``

**PLEASE USE THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES IF DONE WRONG**
